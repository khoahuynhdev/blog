I firmly believe that "get things done" is one of the most important characteristics for software engineer.

These are some insights(in any order) about "get things done" which I believe show me the importance of getting things done.

1. Core value at [GEEKUp](https://geekadventure.vn/)

2. Quality for hiring according to [Joel Spolsky](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2006/10/25/the-guerrilla-guide-to-interviewing-version-30/)

3. "The primary thing when you take a sword in your hands is your intention to cut the enemy, whatever the means. Whenever you parry, hit, spring, strike or touch the enemy's cutting sword, you must cut the enemy in the same movement. It is essential to attain this. If you think only of hitting, springing, striking or touching the enemy, you will not be able actually to cut him." - Miyamoto Musashi in [The Book of Five Rings](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/38725-the-primary-thing-when-you-take-a-sword-in-your)

4. "Engineer must care only about speed—close tasks as soon as possible — which means make money." - Yegor Bugayenko in [Don't Aim for Quality, Aim for Speed](https://www.yegor256.com/2018/03/06/speed-vs-quality.html)

When you "get things done" with positive outcome, you become a better version of yourself.
