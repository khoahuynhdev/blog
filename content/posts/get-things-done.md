I firmly believe that "get things done" is one of the most important characteristics for software engineer.

1. Core value at [GEEKUp](https://geekadventure.vn/)
2. Quality for hiring according to [Joel Spolsky](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2006/10/25/the-guerrilla-guide-to-interviewing-version-30/)
3. Miyamoto Musashi quote: "The primary thing when you take a sword in your hands is your intention to cut the enemy, whatever the means. ... If you think only of hitting, springing, striking or touching the enemy, you will not be able actually to cut him."
